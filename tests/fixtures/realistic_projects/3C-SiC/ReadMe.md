## Folders scheme

- **paper** text of the paper
  - **figures** sub-folder for the generation of final figures
- **analysis** notebooks and other scripts/programs for the analysis of data
- **data** folders for calculation results (raw computational and experimental data)

## Files in the root directory

- **README.md** this file
- **OpenData.yaml** metadata file in YAML format, it is shaped after MyST metadata
  and can be used directly as a header for the paper if it is written
  in [MyST](https://mystmd.org/). Only `authors` and `id` fields are used
  in the automatic creation of the project access data. The rest of the metadata
  fields conform to the system developed for the new IFJ OpenData system.
