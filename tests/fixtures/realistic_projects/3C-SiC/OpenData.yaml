summary: >
  This dataset contains calculations of thermal conductivity of
  cubic SiC using ab-initio DFT force calculations, HECSS sampling
  of thermodynamic ensamble and ALAMODE fitted interaction model.

abstract: >
  Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been 
  calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic 
  interaction model was built using displacement-force data 
  generated with High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling 
  (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces.
