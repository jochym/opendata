  title: "Ab initio study of the anharmonic properties and thermal conductivity in β-FeSi2"
  short_title: "FeSi2 systems"
  description: >
    Iron silicides are good candidates for applications in optoelectronic and
    thermoelectric devices. Lattice dynamical properties and thermal
    conductivity in the β-FeSi2 semiconductor are investigated with the
    first-principles computational methods. Phonon dispersion relations are
    calculated via the temperature-dependent effective potential method and
    self-consistent phonon theory. To properly model thermal transport, we
    explicitly consider the impact of phonon-phonon interactions by analyzing
    anharmonic contributions to the phonon self-energy. This yields
    temperature-dependent phonon frequencies and linewidths, reflecting the
    finite lifetime of phonons due to scattering processes. The calculated
    phonon frequencies and line profiles are used to obtain the Raman spectra,
    which shows good agreement with the experimental data. We revealed an
    enhanced anharmonic behaviour of the Raman modes with the highest
    frequencies. The lattice thermal conductivity is then obtained as a
    function of temperature and crystallite size within the relaxation-time
    approximation. Phonon transport shows a small anisotropy due to the
    orthorhombic structure, and its temperature dependence corresponds very
    well to the experimental results.
