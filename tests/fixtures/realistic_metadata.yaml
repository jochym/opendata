      We present a first-principles study of the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) calculated via the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). The interatomic force constants (IFCs) up to fourth order were derived using displacement-force relations, obtained from configurations sampled from the thermal equilibrium distribution with an improved High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) method. Our results demonstrate that third-order anharmonic effects play a crucial role in determining phonon lifetimes and heat transport. The calculated $\kappa$ shows good agreement with available experimental data above 120 K, confirming the reliability of the presented approach.

      Lattice dynamical properties and thermal conductivity in the $\beta$-FeSi$_2$ semiconductor are investigated with the first-principles computational methods. Phonon dispersion relations are calculated via the temperature-dependent effective potential method and self-consistent phonon theory. To properly model thermal transport, we explicitly consider the impact of phonon-phonon interactions by analyzing anharmonic contributions to the phonon self-energy. This yields temperature-dependent phonon frequencies and linewidths, reflecting the finite lifetime of phonons due to scattering processes. The lattice thermal conductivity is then obtained as a function of temperature and crystallite size within the relaxation-time approximation.
