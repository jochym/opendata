## Abstract
We report the synthesis of a series of highly porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on zinc(II) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC). The materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. MOF-IFJ-1 exhibits a BET surface area of 1500 m²/g and demonstrates selective CO2 capture at 273 K.

## Experimental Section
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 
Synthesis of MOF-IFJ-1: Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol) and BDC (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF...
